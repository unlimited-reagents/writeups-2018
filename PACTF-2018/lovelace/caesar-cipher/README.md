## Problem
“Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant only taste of death but once.” (1007, 1008) Are you valiant enough to figure this out?

## Hint
There’s a lot of text on the Internet and in print. What if you could send messages using all of that data? But you’d have to pick something pretty famous…
## Writeup
Google the quote to see it's from the play Julius Caesar by Shakespeare. The numbers probably correspond to line and word numbers. For example, `5:6` means the 6th word on the 5th line. We can search through the script of the play to find each of the word, getting "The answer is Cassius".
